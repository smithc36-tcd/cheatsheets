# Benetly optimizations

**Data Structures**
- Packing and encoding: Techniques for representing data more compactly or efficiently, which can reduce memory usage and improve performance.
- Augmentation: Enhancing existing data structures by adding extra information or attributes, which can speed up specific operations or queries.
- Precomputation: Computing results ahead of time, storing them, and later using these precomputed values to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.
- Compile-time initialization: Initializing data structures or variables at compile-time instead of runtime, which can reduce startup overhead and improve performance.
- Caching: Storing the results of expensive computations or frequently accessed data in memory for quicker access in subsequent requests.
- Lazy evaluation: Deferring the computation of a value or the execution of an operation until the result is actually needed, which can improve performance in some cases.
- Sparsity: Exploiting the presence of many zero or insignificant elements in data structures to save memory and improve performance through specialized algorithms or data structures.

**Loops**
- Hoisting: Moving loop-invariant code (i.e., code that doesn't change within the loop) outside the loop to reduce redundant computations and improve performance.
- Sentinels: Placing a special value at the end of a data structure to eliminate the need for boundary checks during iterations, potentially improving loop performance.
- Loop unrolling: Transforming a loop to execute multiple iterations in a single iteration, reducing loop overhead and improving performance.
- Loop fusion: Combining two or more loops with similar bounds into a single loop, reducing loop overhead and improving cache locality.
- Eliminating wasted iterations: Removing unnecessary iterations from a loop, which can improve performance by reducing the number of executed instructions.

**Logic**
- Constant folding and propagation: Simplifying expressions involving constants at compile-time, which can reduce the number of runtime operations and improve performance.
- Common-subexpression elimination: Identifying and eliminating redundant computations by reusing previously computed results, which can improve performance.
- Algebraic identities: Using algebraic rules and properties to simplify expressions or computations, which can improve performance by reducing the number of operations.
- Short-circuiting: Terminating the evaluation of a boolean expression as soon as the result is known, which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary evaluations.
- Ordering tests: Rearranging conditional expressions or tests based on their likelihood of occurrence or their cost, which can improve performance.
- Creating a fast path: Adding a separate code path optimized for common or simple cases, which can improve performance by bypassing more complex or general code.
- Combining tests: Merging multiple tests into a single test to reduce the number of branches and improve performance.

**Functions**
- Inlining: Replacing a function call with the body of the function, which can reduce function call overhead and improve performance.
- Tail-recursion elimination: Converting tail-recursive functions (i.e., functions where the recursive call is the last operation) into iterative versions, which can reduce stack usage and improve performance.
- Coarsening recursion: Aggregating multiple levels of recursion into a single recursive call, which can reduce the overhead of recursive function calls and improve performance.
